# Evaluation-for-Linear-Polynomial-and-Multiple-Regression-SVM-Random-Forest-and-Decision-Tree

I performed evaluations using multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Multiple Regression. Additionally, I applied machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree to further analyze and compare their performance on the dataset
